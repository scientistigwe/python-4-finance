Python Application for a Financial Calculator
Introduction
A financial calculator is a specialized tool designed to perform complex calculations related to finance, investments, loans, and more. Building a financial calculator using Python can leverage the language's flexibility, efficiency, and extensive libraries for numerical computations and data handling.

Core Functionalities
A comprehensive financial calculator should encompass the following core functionalities:

Basic Arithmetic
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Percentage calculations (increase, decrease, percentage of a number)
Financial Calculations
Time Value of Money:
Future Value (FV)
Present Value (PV)
Net Present Value (NPV)
Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
Loan amortization
Annuity calculations
Investment Analysis:
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
Return on Investment (ROI)
Profit and Loss calculations
Statistical Functions:
Mean, median, mode, standard deviation
Correlation and regression analysis
Currency Conversion:
Real-time exchange rates (using external APIs)
Additional Features (Optional)
Mortgage Calculator:
Calculate monthly payments, total interest paid, amortization schedule
Savings Calculator:
Estimate future savings based on contributions and interest rates
Retirement Planning:
Calculate required savings for retirement goals
Investment Portfolio Analysis:
Track and analyze investment performance
Tax Calculations:
Basic tax calculations (can be integrated with tax-specific libraries)
Python Libraries
NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation
